# PAM3000-Sensor-Visualizer

## Functions

### Stoppuhr
Clicking on the menu Stoppuhr leads to the function time measurement with start and stop signals.

Sensor 1 = Start signal

Sensor 2 = Stop signal

All measurements over middle range are marked blue.

The button Referenz saves the current measurement as a reference. It will show the diference for the following meassurements.

Needed adapter type A

---

### Doppel-Stoppuhr
Time measurements for slave cylinders (Absenkstationen)

All measurements over middle range are marked blue.

Needed adapter type A

---

### Geschwindigkeitsanzeige Takt
Speed measurement for machines with internal tact sensors.

Needed adapter type ?

---

### Sortierer
Speed measurment with light barrier on the outlet side of the sorter.

Only values with a minimum of 50% of the highest value are taken into consideration. All values under the median are marked red.

Light barrier type:
[= o  ] Light sensor with reflection
[- o -] Light barrier

Needed adapter type B

---

### Analogeanzeige
Clicking on the menu *Analoganzeige* leads to the function "read analog input". Clicking the following options will show you the current measurement form 4-20mA.

| Option                      | Range                              | Adapter type |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Pressure measurement**    | 10bar, 20bar, 40bar, 50bar, 100bar | Type C       |
| **Temperature measurement** | 100째C, 150째C, 350째C                | Type C       |
| **Flow measurement**        | 2500 Nl/min                        | Type F       |

"Set 0" will set the current value back to 4mA.

The function Berechnung is used for calculating a flow measurement.

The function Graphik will draw a graph with the current selected sensor measurements. The time frame can be selected. 

The function Export can be used after a completed measurement of a graph. It will export all measurements in to a text file on the SD card. The values get directly imported to an excel file with a graph. Pushing the button Export deletes the previous file and creates a new one.

### IO Tester
Signal test of sensors.

Needed adapter type U

---

### Magnetpolanzeige
Displays the south pole / north pole of a magnet

The sensor is built-in to the side of the PAM3000. The magnet gets detected inside of the circle area.

---

### Speed Sensor
Displays speed of the adapter.
1. Press Start button
2. Hold the speed sensor wheel on the surface you want to measure
3. Speed is displayed in m/min

The function Referenz saves the current speed. The next meassurement at 50Hz displays the needed frequency adjustment.

Needed adapter type V

---

### Einstellungen
Adjustments to time/date, I2C-scanner and the buzzer volume

---
